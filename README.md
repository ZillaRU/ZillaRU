#### Hi there 👋 
I'm Zhongying, a computer science grad with a knack for all things engineering. From diving into out-of-distribution detection at Hikvision to cracking the code on storage systems at Huawei, I've honed my engineering prowess. During my stint at Nutshell Therapeutics, I rocked algorithm reproduction and bioinformatics, showcasing my knack for quick learning. At Sophgo, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer focusing on open-source AIGC method deployment. Now, I've joined ByteDance where I'm diving deep into AI infrastructure and model optimization, working on cutting-edge solutions for large-scale deployment. I'm all about staying ahead of the curve, soaking up the latest AI trends, and infusing them into real-world projects. Ready to connect, collaborate, and drive innovation in tech! 🚀
